# behavior-dynamics
I worked on this project together with an Italian coleague for the behavior dynamics course during my exhange year in Amsterdam.

We wanted to investigate how the Social Contagion Process works for one of the most subjective opinion, the music taste.
The general questions about this are:
 How does the connection between the users evolves with respect to their musical taste?
 Is there the formation of clusters of users based on the same taste?
 Does the difference of musical taste of the users affect the shape of the network?

In order to give an answer to the question just presented, we decided to use the website Last.fm which is, as they say, 
a music recommendation service - one of the most popular sites about music which allows the user discovering more music 
similar to its taste.

The idea is to define a social contagion model since a lot of behavior phenomena have been found to spread through agents
of social networks in a contagious manner. Considering the nature of the topic we have chosen, we thought to adopt a dynamic 
network based on a homophily principle which states, in a totally different manner from the famous quote that opposites attract, 
the more you’re alike, the more you like. Based on this, the connection strengths of our network are getting stronger the more
the music taste between agents is similar.

Please take a look at the pdf file for the results and more detailed documentation. Or dig into the code to see how its done :)
